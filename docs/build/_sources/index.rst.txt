Hello, I am Sebastian Blauth, a scientific employee at `Fraunhofer ITWM <https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en.html>`_. I work in the department `Transport Processes <https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/tv.html>`_ in the group `Fluid Dynamical Process Design <https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/tv/fluid-dynamical-process-design.html>`_. 

Before becoming a scientific employee at Fraunhofer ITWM, I was a PhD student at TU Kaiserslautern (now RPTU Kaiserslautern Landau) and Fraunhofer ITWM under the supervision of `René Pinnau <https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/en/techno/people/head/pinnau>`_ and `Christian Leithäuser <https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/tv/staff/christian-leithaeuser.html>`_. If you are interested, you can find my PhD Thesis `here <https://publica.fraunhofer.de/entities/publication/45e8f216-f675-47f2-b7a9-d77151d5ff25/details>`_. Previous to that, I have studied mathematics (Bachelor) and industrial mathematics (Master) at TU Kaiserslautern.
