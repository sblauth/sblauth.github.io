   Sebastian Blauth (`sebastian.blauth@itwm.fraunhofer.de <mailto:sebastian.blauth@itwm.fraunhofer.de>`_)



Hello, I am Sebastian Blauth, a scientific employee at `Fraunhofer ITWM <https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en.html>`_. I work in the department `Transport Processes <https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/tv.html>`_ in the group `Fluid Dynamical Process Design <https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/tv/fluid-dynamical-process-design.html>`_. My research mainly focuses on shape optimization with particular regards to industrial applications and the development of efficient solution methods for such problems.

Before becoming a scientific employee at Fraunhofer ITWM, I was a PhD student at TU Kaiserslautern (now RPTU Kaiserslautern Landau) and Fraunhofer ITWM under the supervision of `René Pinnau <https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/en/techno/people/head/pinnau>`_ and `Christian Leithäuser <https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/tv/staff/christian-leithaeuser.html>`_, where I worked on PDE constrained shape optimization and optimal control in the field of microchannel systems. If you are interested, you can find my PhD Thesis `here <https://doi.org/10.24406/publica-fhg-283725>`__. Previous to that, I have studied mathematics (Bachelor) and industrial mathematics (Master) at TU Kaiserslautern (and you can find my Master's thesis `here <https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:hbz:386-kluedo-53727>`_).

I am the main developer of the software package `cashocs <https://cashocs.readthedocs.io>`_, which is an open source software for the automated solution of shape optimization and optimal control problems. It can be used to solve problems in fluid dynamics and multiphysics contexts. If you are interested in applications solved with cashocs, you can find some of them `here <https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/tv/products-and-services/shape-optimization-cashocs-software.html>`__. Moreover, `here <https://youtu.be/mZerFCRLtgQ?si=MDl3SmvU3GcQz-7w>`__ you can find a recording of me giving giving an introduction to cashocs at the FEniCS 2024 conference.
